The project focuses on predicting housing prices based on various features such as location, size, and amenities. The goal is to develop a predictive model using linear regression to estimate the price of a house given these attributes. The process begins by loading and preprocessing the dataset, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables. The data is then split into training and testing sets. A linear regression model is trained on the training set, and its performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2). Finally, the actual and predicted prices are compared to assess the model's accuracy and effectiveness.
